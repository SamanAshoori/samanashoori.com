        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As a cringe millenial would say - I did a thing - which is technically true</p>
        <p>I have been working with the Danish housing market dataset on kaggle and had some fun with it</p>
        <p>Here is the link to the notebook: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/samanashoori/danish-house-market-analysis" target="_blank">Danish Housing Market</a></p>
        <p>I did this project because I realised - I havent done a self serving data analysis project in a while but I decided to try this out and thought it would be fun which it was</p>
        <p>The time is currently 3:11am - on the 18th January 2025.</p>
        <p>I included one of the graphs on this page but you'll have to explore the rest for yourself (no suprise the capital is the most expensive)</p>
