      <h4>Data Analyst Apprentice- SMRS</h4>
      <h5>(September 2023 - Present)</h5>
      <p>At SMRS I started as a Data Analyst apprentice but because of my previous coding and computer science background it was no issue keeping up with the training.</p>
      <p>I have worked on projects that involved me using Python, Tableau, Power BI and other tools.</p>
      <p>Outside of my scope of work - I created some programs to work with APIs to improve processes within the company as well as other automation using python.</p>

      <h5>(September 2018 - Present)</h5>
      <p>I have worked at a range of Retail and Hospitality companies before and during my University studies and during my apprenticeship. From 2022 I have at least always had 2 jobs</p>
      <p>Greggs - Team Member to Shift Leader (2018-2022), Revolution - Bartender (2022-2025), Aldi - Store Assitant (2023-2025) </p>
      <p>I have mainly done this to supplment my apprenticeship income as well as keeping contact with colleagues I like</p>
      <p>I have managed my time well to make sure I still get sleep, gym and social life without it affecting my work </p>
