                <h4>(September 2023 - Present)</h4>
                <p>At SMRS I started as a Data Analyst apprentice but because of my previous coding and computer science background - I did well on the training</p>
                <p>I have worked on projects that involved me using Python, Tableau, Power BI and other tools.</p>
                <p>Outside of my scope of work - I created some programs to work with APIs to improve processes within the company as well as other automation using python.</p>
                <h3>Retail and Hospitality</h3>
                <h4>(September 2018 - Present)</h4>
                <p>I have worked at a range of Retail and Hospitality companies before and during my University studies and during my apprenticeship. From 2022 I have at least always had 2 jobs</p>

                <p>I have mainly done this to supplment my apprenticeship income as well as keeping contact with colleagues I like</p>
                <p>I have managed my time well to make sure I still get sleep, gym and social life without it affecting my work</p>
