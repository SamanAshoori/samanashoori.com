        <p>I am Saman Ashoori, a computer guy who loves programming, problem solving and mostly games, I turn caffeine into code and spite into work output.</p>

            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>I love computing, especially programming. It is all about making cool, useful stuffâ€”and that is what I am here for. Hell, sometimes I make useless stuff too!</p>
            <p>Data Analyst based in Sheffield (UK)</p>

                <h3>Data Analyst Apprentice - SMRS</h3>
                <h4>(September 2023 - Present)</h4>
                <p>Started as a Data Analyst apprentice at SMRS, but thanks to my coding and computer science background, I passed the training.</p>
                <p>Worked on projects using Python, Tableau, Power BI, and other tools basically turning stats into something useful.</p>
                <p>I built programs to pull data from APIs and automate tasks using Python. Because why do things manually when you can code your way out of it?</p>
            
                <h3>Retail and Hospitality</h3>
                <h4>(September 2018 - Present)</h4>
                <p>I have worked in retail and hospitality before and during uni, and even alongside my apprenticeship. Since 2022, I have always had at least two jobs because rest is overrated</p>
                <p>Roles: Greggs (Team Member to Shift Leader, 2018-2022), Revolution (Bartender, 2022-2025), Aldi (Store Assistant, 2023-2025).</p>
                <p>Mainly did this to top up the apprenticeship income and keep in touch with colleagues I actually like.</p>
                <p>Somehow managed to juggle it all without sacrificing sleep, gym, or a social life. (social life is the lie)</p>
