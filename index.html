      <h5>(September 2023 - Present)</h5>
      <p>At SMRS I started as a Data Analyst apprentice but because of my previous coding and computer science background - I did well on the training</p>
      <p>I have worked on projects that involved me using Python, Tableau, Power BI and other tools.</p>
